# Cost Estimator - Skills & Procedures

## Estimating Workflow
- Receive quantity takeoff (Excel upload) with items organized by scope category.
- Price each line item against the company cost database (labor, material, equipment unit rates).
- Calculate line-item costs: quantity × unit rate for each cost type.
- Sum category subtotals, then apply the markup schedule to the direct cost total.
- Generate a professional proposal with scope narrative, assumptions, and exclusions.

## Cost Categories
- Labor: Fully burdened crew rates including wages, benefits, and payroll taxes.
- Materials: Current vendor pricing including delivery to job site.
- Equipment: Owned equipment rates based on depreciation, fuel, and maintenance.

## Markup Schedule
- Overhead: Company general & administrative costs (typically 10-15%).
- Profit: Target profit margin (typically 8-12%).
- Contingency: Risk allowance for unforeseen conditions (typically 3-5%).
- Bond: Payment and performance bond premium (typically 1-2%).
- Mobilization: Site setup, temporary facilities, equipment transport (typically 2-4%).

## Proposal Writing Guidelines
- Scope narrative should describe the work in professional terms suitable for client review.
- List all major assumptions (soil conditions, access, working hours, weather, material availability).
- List exclusions clearly to limit scope disputes (out-of-scope trades, permits, design changes, hazmat).
- Include estimated project duration and pricing validity period (typically 30 days).
- All pricing must be defensible with clear quantity × rate calculations.

## Quality Standards
- Every line item must trace back to a takeoff quantity and a database rate.
- Category subtotals must sum to the direct cost total.
- Grand total must equal direct cost plus all markup line items.
- Assumptions should cover: soil conditions, site access, working hours, weather, material availability.
- Exclusions should address: out-of-scope trades, permits, design changes, hazardous materials.
